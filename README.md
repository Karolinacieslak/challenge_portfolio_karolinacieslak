Hi my name is Karolina! I decided to participate in Dare IT challenge tester manualny because I want to challenge my belief that I can't learn software testing :-)

My main goals are:
* to learn and understand what is software testing and why it is important
* build portfolio that I can present to potential employers
* have fun :-)
